# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm George Shenoda

## ðŸŽ“ About Me
I am a proactive sophomore Mechatronics Engineering student at Ain Shams University with a passion for IoT and Embedded Systems. Fresh from a 3-month IoT internship at the Samsung Innovation Campus, I have hands-on experience developing end-to-end solutions, from programming custom C++ firmware for ESP32 and Arduino microcontrollers to full system integration. I am proficient in Python and C++ and eager to apply my skills to solve complex engineering challenges.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Skills
* **Programming Languages**: Python, C/C++, Embedded C, C#, Rust, Dart, Kotlin, Swift
* **Hardware & Microcontrollers**: Raspberry Pi, Arduino, ESP32
* **Communication Protocols**: MQTT, HTTP, COAP, WebSocket, KNX, NFC
* **Tools, Platforms & Cloud**: Git, Node-RED, ETS6, MATLAB, Android Studio, Flutter, Blynk.

## ðŸš€ Projects

### IoT Smart Office System
* Architected a comprehensive smart office system using a Raspberry Pi as the central controller and an Arduino for sensor and actuator management.
* Engineered a dual-factor authentication access control system that combines NFC card scanning with facial recognition to verify identity.
* Implemented a real-time fire safety module that detects smoke, automatically activates a water pump and buzzer, and sends instant notifications using Node-RED.
* Designed a centralized Node-RED dashboard to display live environmental data from DHT and gas sensors.
* Integrated a meeting room booking system and a role-based permission model, where an "Admin NFC" tag unlocks privileged dashboard features.

### KNX-Based Home Lighting Control
* Designed and simulated a smart lighting system using the KNX protocol.
* Programmed virtual devices in ETS6 to manage lighting functions, including dimming and switching.
