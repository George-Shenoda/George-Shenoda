## ðŸš€ Projects

### IoT Smart Office System
* [span_13](start_span)Architected a comprehensive smart office system using a Raspberry Pi as the central controller and an Arduino for sensor and actuator management[span_13](end_span).
* [span_14](start_span)Engineered a dual-factor authentication access control system that combines NFC card scanning with facial recognition to verify identity[span_14](end_span).
* [span_15](start_span)Implemented a real-time fire safety module that detects smoke, automatically activates a water pump and buzzer, and sends instant notifications using Node-RED[span_15](end_span).
* [span_16](start_span)Designed a centralized Node-RED dashboard to display live environmental data from DHT and gas sensors[span_16](end_span).
* [span_17](start_span)Integrated a meeting room booking system and a role-based permission model, where an "Admin NFC" tag unlocks privileged dashboard features[span_17](end_span).

### KNX-Based Home Lighting Control
* [span_18](start_span)Designed and simulated a smart lighting system using the KNX protocol[span_18](end_span).
